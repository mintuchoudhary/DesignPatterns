 *  Flyweight design pattern is used when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class
 *  Flyweight pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving application required objects structure.
 *  Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects (say 105). 
 *  One important feature of flyweight objects is that they are immutable. 
 *  This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.
