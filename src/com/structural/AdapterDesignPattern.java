/*

Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible
 interfaces. This pattern involves a single class
 which is responsible to join functionalities
 of independent or incompatible interfaces
 (adaptees).



A real life example could be a case
 of card reader which acts as an adapter
 between memory card and a laptop.
 You plugin the memory card into card
 reader and card reader into the laptop
 so that memory card can be read via 
laptop.
